		<h1>Thoughts</h1>
		<h2>
			My thoughts are absorbing me. What thoughts are? Why they're trying to kill me inside?<br>
			I don't know actually. But what I know is that I changed again. My mind was consumed by others neither others was consumed by my mind. What was change? Feeling of world. Understanding of it's structure. In other words I reborn with new sight of the world and it's details.<br>
			What should I do with it? I don't know actually, but what I know is that I should abandon what I thought was good. I should proceed to the new me.<br>
			To the new myself.<br>
			With this sight I saw things that I wasn't able to see not so long ago. It's surrender. It's pleasure. It's clear.<br>
			Now time to question again... who am I? Or who I am?<br>
			Time to go through my fear. Time to see what I made out of.
